This is my first project using ES6 Modules!

For this todo app I used date-fns & uuidv4, both helped immenseley and I will definitely use for future projects. Using date-fns simplified the process of managing the task due dates and allowed me an easy way to set up a snooze +1 day function when the date is clicked. uuidv4 made the process of giving each note/project and the tasks within a completely random id - which made it simple to set up event listeners and searcing through arrays to delete the items.

While I was building this I started using the app at work to see if it would fulfill a regular users needs. It did a good job but could definitely use some added functionality such as editing tasks and priorities - something to keep in mind if I come back to this. Unfortunately for now, I must get cracking with the next project!
